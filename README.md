# hello-world
# yet another hello-world repository

Hi, I'm KDG and I'm exploring GitHub. So far, so good.

I'm editing again.

And again at 6:36 pm.

It's 1:31 pm on Sunday now. I removed hello-world from desktop - and it disappeared from github folder. Then I cloned from GitHub.com (had to suspend vpn first). Then hello-world appears in desktop and in folder. I'll try to get it back to GitHub.com now.
