# hello-world
# yet another hello-world repository

Hi, I'm KDG and I'm exploring GitHub. So far, so good.

It's 1501 now and I'm editing readme in Atom. Plan is to save the edits and then commit the changes in 1500 branch in desktop. Then I'll publish the branch to GitHub.com.  I'll finish up there.

Let's try this one more time.

1639 Now I'm editing in WordPad in my GitHub folder - opened in Explorer from desktop.

1647 Now I'm editing directly in my GitHub folder - using WordPad.
